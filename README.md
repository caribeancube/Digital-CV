## Profile
Astute process engineer with over 20 years of experience in the semiconductor industry. Experienced in multidisciplinary fields in design and manufacturing of semiconductor-based nanotechnology ranging from pure university research to product development for startups and established firms. Since joining the [Cornell NanoScale Facility](https://www.cnf.cornell.edu/) in 2006 as a resident staff engineer, I have worked in photolithography and nanofabrication including wafer bonding, nanoimprinting, [two-photon lithography](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CNFUserWiki/Two-photon+Lithography), CAD model design, tool maintenance, and reverse engineering for aging industrial semiconductor machinery. I take a hands-on approach to problem-solving and I enjoy collaborating with researchers and students from around the world to accomplish their goals in my areas of expertise.

## Experience
#### SEPTEMBER  2006 - JUNE 2022
[Cornell NanoScale Facility](https://www.cnf.cornell.edu/), Ithaca NY 
- *Photolithography Process Engineer / Research Support Specialist II*
	- I manage overall process control, training,  and maintenance for over 24 individual machines. I have purchased, installed, developed processes and the associated documentation, created training manuals, webpages, and training videos, maintained, re-engineered, and decommissioned Semiconductor Capital Equipment.  I also support CNF resident and non-resident user projects in my areas of expertise.
	- Annually I have prevented hundreds of hours of machine downtime and saved over $100K in costs by designing and manufacturing parts from a wide range of materials. I have implemented novel ideas as hardware and software additions to improve the overall usage and performance of equipment.
	- My inquisitive mind keeps me on top of new technology, and I have developed an exceptionally strong ability to quickly teach myself how to optimize machines and processes.  
	- My work done to show CNFâ€™s capabilities on through [the Nano-Size McGraw Clock Tower](https://www.cnf.cornell.edu/highlights/tools/nanoscribe/clocktower) has been featured in a handful of news outlets. 

### FEBRUARY 2005 - MARCH 2006

## Interests
- When not working on a tool or in the lab I am trying to improve it. I am a good team player and bring to the table a specialized set of highly technical skills. Outside of the office;  a social butterfly and active in the Latin dancing scene with an occasional hand-rolled cigar. Other interests include astrophysics, quantum physics, reverse engineering, additive manufacturing, game development, bread baking, beer brewing, carpentry, woodworking, leather crafting, blacksmithing,  drawing,  perfumery, photography,  music and video production, dancing, and cooking.
